# Welcome to The Holocron

This site is a wiki and blog for my adventures in (primarily defensive) cybersecurity. It's a combination of 5+ years of notes, experiences, mistakes, and lessons learned.

This project is a bit different than other personal sites because I want to actively ask for **your** input! That's right, you! Check out the \[Contributing\](contributing.md) doc for more information, either here or on \[GitHub\](<https://github.com/CyberInPublic/holocron-wiki>).

## Commands

- `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
